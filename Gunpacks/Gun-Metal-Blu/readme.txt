-- INSTALLATION GUIDE --
WARNING: As of 1.3, GMB:TI Will No longer work with VPB 1.6, Or VPB in general.
Please switch to PB:J by corrinedev Before installing!
How to install:
First, If you haven't already, Make a "pointblank" folder in you're ".minecraft"
folder, it should be something like C:/USER/appdata/.minecraft/pointblank/GMB_V(versionnumber).zip.
the text versionnumber just means the number of the version, for example the zip could be titled: GMB_V1.3.zip, Or GMB_V2.0.zip,
Really depends on which version of the gunpack you currently have. Higher number equals newer version.
Naming scheme:
V1.5 (for example) is a major update.
V1.3.1 (for example) is a minor bugfix/small update.

Kind thanks for installing my gunpack, Sincerely! - The Gun Metal Blu team. (only larsh512 currently lmao)
